## Robot-Based Dismantling of Brick Walls as a Re-Use Product

### Background and Objective

A sustainable approach to the construction industry requires adherence to EU taxonomy, which promotes reuse of materials. Retrieving and reusing clinkers helps conserve resources and reduces environmental impact. By diminishing the grey energy required for manufacturing new building materials, we can significantly reduce our ecological footprint. Furthermore, creating Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) for reused clinkers enables a transparent assessment of their environmental effects. These measures are crucial for fostering the transition to a sustainable, circular construction industry.

> [!NOTE]
> This project aims at setting up a lab demonstrator capable of recognizing and manipulating clinkers. Real-world   trials with our partner SWG in Schweinfurt are also anticipated.

## Tasks

 - Collect and document requirements of the entire process from SWG (dismantling, sorting, cleaning, etc.)
 - Pick 1-2 sub-processes to implement in a lab environment, e.g.
	 - picking clinkers from a pile and placing them onto a pallet
	 - segmenting clinkers into stone and mortar (that needs to be removed)
	 - quality inspection / classification of the clinkers

 - Select and set up a suitable manipulator and sensor system
 - Implement an integrated machine vision and manipulation system capable of fulfilling the sub-processes identified in step 2)
 - Demonstrate your system to the customer, possible at an SWG construction site.
