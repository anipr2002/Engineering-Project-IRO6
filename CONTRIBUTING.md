## Version Control and Git Flow

Whenever you encounter a :beetle: **bug** or have :tada: **feature request**,
report this via [Github issues](TODO: Link to issues).

We are happy to receive contributions to our project in the form of **pull requests** via Github.
Feel free to fork the repository, implement your changes and create a merge request to the `develop` branch.
There is a [forking guide](#forking) available to get you started!

### Branching Guidelines
The development follows a simplified version of **git-flow**: The `main` branch always contains stable code.
New features and bug fixes are implemented in `feature/*` or `fix/*` branches and are merged to `develop` once they are finished.
When a new milestone is reached, the content of `develop` will be merged to `main` and a tag is created.

[Github Actions](TODO: Link to actions) are used for continuous integration.
All pull requests and pushes to `main` and `develop` are built automatically.

### Git Commit Messages
Commits should start with a Capital letter and should be written in present tense (e.g. __:tada: Add cool new feature__ instead of __:tada: Added cool new feature__).
It's a great idea to start the commit message with an applicable emoji. This does not only look great but also makes you rethink what to add to a commit.
* :tada: `:tada:` when adding a cool new feature
* :wrench: `:wrench:` when refactoring / improving a small piece of code
* :hammer: `:hammer:` when refactoring / improving large parts of the code
* :sparkles: `:sparkles:` when formatting code
* :art: `:art:` improving / adding assets like textures or images
* :rocket: `:rocket:` when improving performance
* :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
* :beetle: `:beetle:` when fixing a bug
* :green_heart: `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
* :heavy_check_mark: `:heavy_check_mark:` when working on tests
* :arrow_up_small: `:arrow_up_small:` when adding / upgrading dependencies
* :arrow_down_small: `:arrow_down_small:` when removing / downgrading dependencies
* :twisted_rightwards_arrows: `:twisted_rightwards_arrows:` when merging branches
* :fire: `:fire:` when removing files
* :truck: `:truck:` when moving / renaming files or namespaces

### Forking
This is pretty straight-forward. Just click the **Fork** button on the top right of this page. 
Then clone the forked repository, perform your changes, push to a feature branch and create a pull request to the develop branch.

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:<your user name>/<project name>.git
cd <project name>
git remote add upstream git@github.com:<user/organization>/<project name>.git
git checkout develop

git checkout -b feature/your-new-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix

# ... do and commit your changes!

git push origin feature/your-new-feature
```

When there were changes in the develop branch, you will need to merge those to your fork before creating a pull request:

``` bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/develop
```

Then you can create a pull request on GitHub to the develop branch.

## Development

Refer [ðŸš€Quick Start](/README.md#ðŸš€quick-start) for setting up the Project.

### Requirements

> :bulb: **TIP** <br>
> See the [README.md](./README.md#requirements). Maybe add some further requirements only for contributers here.


### Test Cases


### Documentation

> [!TIP]
> Add meaningful documentation to all classes, functions and fields. Try to be complete, but concise. Don't comment with redudant information like: `int counter; // the counter`.
